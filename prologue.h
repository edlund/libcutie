/* libcutie amalgamation - https://github.com/edlund/libcutie
 * 
 * This file is a part of an amalgamation of the source and
 * header files from libcutie. Two files are required to use
 * an amalgamation of libcutie in another project, namely
 * `cutie.h` and `cutie.c`.
 * 
 * - cutie.h is an amalgamation of all public header files.
 * - cutie.c is an amalgamation of all header and source
 *   files. It makes it possible to compile libcutie as a
 *   single translation unit.
 * 
 * To use an amalgamation to integrate libcutie with another
 * project, simply make sure that
 * 
 * 1) cutie.h is available on one of your include paths and
 * 2) cutie.c is compiled and linked with the rest of your
 *    source files.
 * 
 * For more information, please refer to the README-file for
 * libcutie.
 * 
 * This file was automatically generated, so think twice
 * before making changes to it. Most likely, it is easier
 * to clone the project, make changes to the source and then
 * create a new amalgamation.
